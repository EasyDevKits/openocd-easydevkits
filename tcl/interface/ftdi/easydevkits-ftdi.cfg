# The speed of the JTAG interface, in kHz. If you get DSR/DIR errors (and they
# do not relate to OpenOCD trying to read from a memory range without physical
# memory being present there), you can try lowering this.

# On EasyDevKits, this can go as high as 20MHz if CPU frequency is 80MHz,
# or 26MHz if CPU frequency is 160MHz or 240MHz.
